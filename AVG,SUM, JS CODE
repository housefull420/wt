// Filter out the scores which are above 85
let filteredScores = scores.filter(score => score <= 85);
console.log('Filtered Scores (<= 85):', filteredScores);

// Calculate the total score and average score
let totalScore = scores.reduce((acc, score) => acc + score, 0);
let averageScore = totalScore / scores.length;
console.log('Total Score:', totalScore);
console.log('Average Score:', averageScore);
